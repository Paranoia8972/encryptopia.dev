# Welcome to Encryptopia.dev!

I'm excited to share my new website with you! I built it entirely from scratch because, frankly, I dislike templates. Every part of this site has been carefully crafted, and it's powered by **Next.js** to ensure top performance and a smooth experience.

One of the highlights of this project is achieving a **perfect Lighthouse report**. Whether it’s performance, accessibility, best practices, or SEO, the site ticks all the boxes. If you're curious about how it's built, you can check out the source code on GitHub: [Paranoia8927/encryptopia.dev](https://github.com/Paranoia8927/encryptopia.dev).

## Features

Here are some of the key features of Encryptopia.dev:
- A **clean, responsive design** for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Fast loading times** thanks to optimized code and static generation.
- A **dedicated blog** where I'll share my thoughts, writeups, and more.
- **RSS feed support** so you can keep up with the latest posts easily.
- A **portfolio section** to showcase my projects and skills.

## What's Next?

Most of the content on this site will revolve around **security**, including writeups for future events and challenges. If I can stick to my plan, I'll aim to publish posts on a **biweekly or monthly basis**. I'm already working on a few posts that I think you'll find interesting—stay tuned!

Make sure to follow me on **Twitter**, where I’ll announce new posts. You can also subscribe to my **RSS feed** to stay updated in your favorite reader app.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy what you find here, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon.
