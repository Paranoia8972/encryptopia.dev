          I&apos;m a 15 year old high school student in 10th grade. I love
          exploring and working with Servers (Minecraft, Linux), Web Development
          and Raspberry Pis projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy self-hosting stuff, enhancing my ethical hacking skills, and
          contributing to open-source projects.
