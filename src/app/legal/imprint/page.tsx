        <strong>Liability for content</strong>
        <br />
        As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these
        pages in accordance with general laws according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG.
        However, according to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obligated to monitor
        transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
        circumstances that indicate illegal activity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Obligations to remove or block the use of information under general laws
        remain unaffected. However, liability in this regard is only possible
        from the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification
        of such violations, we will remove this content immediately.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Liability for links</strong>
        <br />
        Our offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose
        contents we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot assume any liability
        for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the
        pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The
        linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of
        linking. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking.
        <br />
        <br />
        However, a permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not
        reasonable without concrete evidence of an infringement. Upon
        notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
        <br />
