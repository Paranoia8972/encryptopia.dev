# Building Type-Safe Applications with Next.js and TypeScript

<Callout type="info">
  This guide assumes basic familiarity with React and JavaScript. We'll focus on TypeScript-specific features and how they integrate with Next.js.
</Callout>

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, helping catch errors before runtime and improving the developer experience. When combined with Next.js, it creates a powerful development environment.

Here's a simple example of type safety in action: 
  
  ```tsx
  // TypeScript ensures `name` is always a string
  function greet(name: string) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
  }
  ```

## Setting Up Next.js with TypeScript

Let's create a new Next.js project with TypeScript support:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --ts
```

This command initializes a new Next.js project with TypeScript support, including necessary configurations and type definitions.

## TypeScript Features in Next.js

Next.js leverages TypeScript features like interfaces, enums, and type aliases to define custom types and improve code readability. Here's an example:

```tsx
// Define a custom type using an interface
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

// Use the custom type in a function
function getUserInfo(user: User) {
  return `User ${user.name} has ID ${user.id}`;
}
```

## Migrating Existing Next.js Projects to TypeScript

If you have an existing Next.js project in JavaScript, migrating to TypeScript is straightforward. Rename your `.js` files to `.tsx` and install TypeScript:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript @types/react @types/node
```

Next, update your `tsconfig.json` file to include TypeScript configurations and start using type annotations in your code.

## Conclusion

TypeScript enhances Next.js applications by providing type safety, better code navigation, and improved developer productivity. Start using TypeScript in your Next.js projects to unlock these benefits and build robust web applications.
