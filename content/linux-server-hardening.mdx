# Linux Server Security Hardening Guide

## SSH Hardening

First, let's secure SSH access: 

1. **Change Default Port**: Modify `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and set a custom port (e.g., 2222).
2. **Disable Root Login**: Prevent root login by setting `PermitRootLogin no`.
3. **Limit User Access**: Use `AllowUsers` to restrict SSH access to specific users.
4. **SSH Keys**: Disable password authentication and use SSH keys for secure login.
5. **Firewall Rules**: Allow SSH port and restrict access to trusted IPs only.

## Firewall Setup

Next, configure the firewall:

1. **Firewalld**: Use `firewall-cmd` to manage firewall rules.
2. **Default Policies**: Set default policies to `DROP` for input, output, and forward chains.
3. **Allow Specific Ports**: Open only necessary ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22) for services.
4. **Logging**: Enable firewall logging to monitor traffic and detect suspicious activities.

## Security Best Practices

Finally, follow these security best practices:

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep the system up-to-date with the latest security patches.
2. **File Permissions**: Set appropriate file permissions and restrict access to sensitive data.
3. **Monitoring**: Use tools like `fail2ban` to monitor login attempts and block malicious IPs.
4. **Backup**: Implement regular backups to prevent data loss in case of a security breach.

By following these steps, you can significantly improve the security of your Linux server and protect it from potential threats.
