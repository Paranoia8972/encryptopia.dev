I built it entirely from scratch because I dislike templates. It's powered by **Next.js** to ensure top performance and a smooth experience.

One of the highlights of this project is a almost **perfect Lighthouse report**. Whether it’s performance, accessibility, best practices, or SEO, the site ticks all the boxes. If you're curious about how it's built, you can check out the source code on GitHub: [Paranoia8972/encryptopia.dev](https://github.com/Paranoia8972/encryptopia.dev).

## Features

Here are some of the key features of Encryptopia.dev:

- **Clean and responsive design** for both desktop and mobile users.
- **Fast loading times** thanks to optimized code and static generation.
- A **dedicated blog** where I'll share my thoughts, writeups, and more.
- **RSS feed support** so you can keep up with the latest posts easily.
- **Table of contents** for longer posts to navigate more efficiently.
- **Dark mode only** - who even uses light mode anyway?

## What's Next?

Most of the content on this site will revolve around **security**, including writeups for future events and challenges. If I can stick to my plan, I'll aim to publish posts on a **biweekly or monthly basis**.

Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://x.com/Paranoia8972), where I’ll announce new posts. You can also subscribe to my **RSS feed** to stay updated in your favorite reader app.

Thanks for stopping by! I hope you enjoy what you find here, and I look forward to sharing more with you soon.
