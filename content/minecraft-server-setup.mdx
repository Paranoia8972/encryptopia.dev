## Prerequisites

- A Linux server (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended)
- At least 4GB RAM
- Java 17 or higher

## Server Setup

First, let's install the required dependencies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ubuntu/Debian">
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="CentOS">
    ```bash
    sudo dnf install java-17-openjdk-headless
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Server Configuration

Here's my optimized server.properties configuration: 
  
  ```properties
  # server.properties
  gamemode=survival
  difficulty=hard
  max-players=20
  view-distance=10
  ```

## Installing Paper

Download the latest Paper JAR file from the [official site](https://papermc.io/downloads) and run it using Java:

```bash
wget https://papermc.io/api/v2/projects/paper/versions/1.18.1/builds/415/downloads/paper-1.18.1-415.jar
java -Xms2G -Xmx4G -jar paper-1.18.1-415.jar
```

## Performance Tuning

Optimize the server by adjusting JVM flags and Garbage Collection settings:

```bash
java -Xms4G -Xmx8G -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -jar paper-1.18.1-415.jar
```
